# Troubleshooting Guide for {KERNEL_NAME}

> **⚠️ TODO: Customize this template for your kernel**
> 
> Replace `{KERNEL_NAME}` with your actual kernel name
> Add kernel-specific troubleshooting steps and examples

## Onboarding Issues

### Error: "agent_id is required" or "email is required"
**Solution:** Make sure your request includes both `agent_id` and `email` fields:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "your-unique-agent-id",
  "email": "your-email@example.com"
}
```

### Error: "Onboarding service not configured"
**Solution:** This is a server-side issue. Contact support or try again later.

### Error: "Failed to create tenant"
**Solution:** 
- Check that your `agent_id` is unique
- Verify your email is valid
- Try again - the service may be temporarily unavailable

## API Call Issues

### Error: "Missing or invalid X-API-Key"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're including the `X-API-Key` header (not `x-api-key` or `API-Key`)
- Verify you're using the API key from the onboarding response
- Check for extra spaces or newlines in the API key

### Error: "Invalid API Key"
**Solution:**
- The API key may have been revoked or doesn't exist
- Re-onboard to get a new API key
- Make sure you're using the key from the most recent onboarding

### Error: "Authorization check failed" or Timeout
**Solution:**
- This usually means the authorization service is slow or unavailable
- Wait a few seconds and try again
- If it persists, contact support

### Error: "UPGRADE_REQUIRED"
**Solution:**
- You've reached your free tier limit ({FREE_TIER_LIMIT} calls)
- Add a payment method to continue using the API
- Check your usage: `GET /api/usage` with your API key

## {KERNEL_NAME}-Specific Issues

> **TODO: Add kernel-specific troubleshooting steps here**
> 
> Examples:
> - Common field name mistakes for your actions
> - Validation errors specific to your domain
> - Database constraint errors
> - Action-specific error messages
> 
> **Example format:**
> ```markdown
> ### Error: "{EXAMPLE_ERROR_MESSAGE}"
> **Solution:** {EXAMPLE_SOLUTION}
> 
> ### Error: "Field validation failed"
> **Solution:** Check that {SPECIFIC_FIELD} meets {REQUIREMENT}
> ```

## Common Field Name Mistakes

> **TODO: Document common mistakes for your kernel's actions**
> 
> **Example format:**
> - ❌ `wrong_field_name` → ✅ `correct_field_name`
> - ❌ `old_format` → ✅ `new_format`
> - ❌ `deprecated_field` → ✅ `new_field`
> 
> Document your kernel's common mistakes here. Common issues include:
> - Field name typos or variations
> - Deprecated field names
> - Incorrect data types (string vs number, array vs object)
> - Missing required fields

## Usage and Limits

### How to Check Your Usage
```bash
curl -X GET {YOUR_API_URL}/api/usage \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Free Tier Limits
- **{FREE_TIER_LIMIT} calls per month** included free
- After {FREE_TIER_LIMIT} calls, you'll get `UPGRADE_REQUIRED` error
- Add a payment method to continue

### Warning Messages
If you see a warning in the response like:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {...},
  "warning": {
    "message": "You have {X} free calls remaining..."
  }
}
```
This means you're approaching your limit. Add a payment method soon.

## Getting Help

### Check the API Documentation
See `API-DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete API reference with examples.

### Verify Your Request Format
1. Check that you're using the correct field names
2. Verify your JSON is valid
3. Make sure required fields are present

### Still Having Issues?
1. **Check the error message** - it usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Verify your API key** - make sure it's from the onboarding response
3. **Check field names** - use the exact names from the documentation
4. **Try a simple request first** - start with one action to verify your setup

## Quick Reference

> **TODO: Add quick reference examples for your kernel's most common actions**

### Minimal Valid Request
> **TODO: Add a minimal working example for your most common action**

```json
{
  "action": "{YOUR_ACTION_NAME}",
  "params": {
    // Add minimal example here
    // Replace with your kernel's actual minimal request
  }
}
```
